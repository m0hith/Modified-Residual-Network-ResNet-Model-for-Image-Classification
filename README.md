# Modified Residual Network (ResNet) Model for Image Classification on the CIFAR-10 Dataset

Work done as part of the Deep Learning (ECE-GY 7123) mini-project. The model has been developed by Shashank Shekhar (ss16116), Mohith Jarapala (mpj8687), and Ayanesh Chowdhury (ac10230).

All the models have been based on https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar. An accompanying report detailing the background, model development, and results is provided.

### Dataset:
CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

The CIFAR-10 dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for image classification tasks, particularly in the context of deep learning. It is a challenging dataset due to its small image size and the presence of class overlap, which means that some images can be difficult to classify accurately.

CIFAR-10 is often used for training and evaluating deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and has been used as a basis for a number of research papers in the field of computer vision. The small size of the images in the dataset means that models trained on CIFAR-10 can be trained relatively quickly, which makes it a useful resource for researchers who need to experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters.
